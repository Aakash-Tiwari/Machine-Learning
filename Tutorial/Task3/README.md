# Overview
* Task : 
  * Use line of intercept = -0.3 and slope =0.5 with gaussian noise (mean =0; var = 0.04) to generate 10 sample points (x_i, y_i) between -1 and +1 on x axis
  * Calculate the probability of Gaussian for given mean and variance using library functions
  * Calculate the un-normalized posterior by multiplying (one-to-one) prior and likelihood grids; hence results in the same dimensional grid with posterior probability. Use heat       map to plot the figure.

* Output :
